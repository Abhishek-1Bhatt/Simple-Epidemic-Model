# Simple-Epidemic-Model
This project looks at a simple Stochastic model for the simulation of an outbreak. It presents the compartmental SIR model in a very simple way.
We will develop a stochastic (probabilistic) model of an infection propagating in a population that is well mixed, i.e. in which everyone is in contact with everyone else. An example of this would be a small school or university in which people are constantly moving around and interacting with each other.
The model is an individual-based or agent-based model -- in other words, we explicitly keep track of each individual in the population and what their infection status is.
- This mini project has been inspired from Problem Set 1 of course Computational Thinking With Julia (Spring 2020) taught by Professor David P. Sanders and Professor Alan Edelman.
- A better look at the notebook can be achieved by downloading it as Github has faulty rendering for Jupyter Notebooks. Besides the most creative and amazing plots toward the end require Interact which won't be rendered outside Jupyter Notebook environment.
- The Julia version used here is 1.6.1.
