# Simple-Epidemic-Model
This project looks at a simple Stochastic model for the simulation of an outbreak. It presents the compartmental SIR model in a very simple way.
We will develop a stochastic (probabilistic) model of an infection propagating in a population that is well mixed, i.e. in which everyone is in contact with everyone else. An example of this would be a small school or university in which people are constantly moving around and interacting with each other.
The model is an individual-based or agent-based model -- in other words, we explicitly keep track of each individual in the population and what their infection status is.
- To run the notebook, type ]add IJulia in Julia REPL(given jupyter notebooks is already installed), this will provide the option of running Julia code in Jupyter Notebook.
